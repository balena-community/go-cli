# Balena Go Developer CLI

This is an experimental community project that provides some basic CLI functions for development on balena IoT devices. It was initially built to allow device scanning inside of a container on a Raspberry Pi. It is made available here for others to use and for additional features to be added.

## Basic Usage:

Download the file based on your system type from the releases page. `balena-go -help` will show available options.

There are docker containers published in the `Packages` section of the GitHub repo.

##Â Mutagen

Mutagen is integrated in to this CLI to allow mounting the contents of a container to the local file system. For the service to work, `mutagen-agents.tar.gz` needs to be present alongside the `balena-go` executable as it contains the agents to be deployed in to the running container.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome to help grow the number of features. It may be wise to create an issue or discussion topic before starting to help us all coordinate.
